# madlib_cli by Mason Aviles

## Summary
In this lab assignment you will be creating a command line application which takes advantage of Pythonâ€™s built in capabilities for reading and writing files.

## Feature Tasks
- Create a file called madlib.py at root of madlib_cli folder, which will contain all of the Python code that you will write relating to your Madlib game.
- Create a file called test_madlib.py in root of tests folder which will be used to test your executable command line script.
- build a command line tool which will perform the following:
  - Print a welcome message to the user, explaining the Madlib process and command line interactions
  - Read a template Madlib file (Example), and parse that file into usable parts.
    - You need to decide what components of this file are useful, and how to break those useful pieces apart
  - Once you know what parts of the template need user input, such as Adjective, prompt the user to submit a series of words to fit each of the required components of the Madlib template. 
  - With the collected user inputs, populate the template such that each provided input is placed into the correct position within the template.
  - After the resulting Madlib has been completed, provide the completed response back to the user in the command line.
  - Write the completed text (Example)to a new file on your file system (in the repo).
  - Note: A smaller example file is included as well which can be handy when developing/testing.
